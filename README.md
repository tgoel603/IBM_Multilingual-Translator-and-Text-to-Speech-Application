# IBM_Multilingual-Translator-and-Text-to-Speech-Application

In an increasingly globalized world, the ability to communicate across languages is more 
important than ever. Language barriers, however, continue to hinder access to 
information, education, and social interaction. To bridge this communication gap, our team 
developed a multilingual translator with integrated text-to-speech capabilities. This user
friendly application enables real-time translation across 100+ languages and provides 
audio output for better pronunciation understanding. The tool is designed to assist in 
language learning, improve accessibility, and support seamless global interaction.
